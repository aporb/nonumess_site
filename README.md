   ```javascript
   // Replace these with your actual EmailJS credentials
   const USER_ID = "YOUR_USER_ID";
   const SERVICE_ID = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID";
   const TEMPLATE_ID = "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID";
   ```

### Site Configuration

}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Customizing Content

#### Modifying Services

Edit the services in `src/components/Services.astro`:

```astro
<div class="service">
  <h3>Home Organization</h3>
  <p>Transform cluttered spaces into functional, beautiful areas that enhance your daily life.</p>
</div>
```

#### Updating Gallery Images

Replace images in the `public/images` directory and update references in `src/components/Gallery.astro`:

```astro
<div class="before-after">
  <img src="/images/before-after-1.jpg" alt="Before and after transformation of a kitchen pantry" />
  <div class="caption">Kitchen Pantry Transformation</div>
</div>
```

#### Adding Testimonials

Modify testimonials in `src/components/Testimonials.astro`:

```astro
<div class="testimonial">
  <div class="quote">"Working with NoNuMess completely transformed my home office. I can finally find everything!"</div>
  <div class="author">- Sarah T., Los Angeles</div>
</div>
```

## üì¶ Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static files in the `dist/` directory that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Deploying to Dreamhost

See the detailed instructions in `dreamhost-deployment-guide.md` for deploying to Dreamhost shared hosting.

Key points:
- Build the site locally
- Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting
- No server-side dependencies needed (EmailJS works client-side)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Form Not Sending Emails
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify EmailJS credentials are correctly set
- Ensure your EmailJS account is active and within usage limits

#### Images Not Loading
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check that images exist in the `public/images` directory
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

#### Dark Mode Toggle Not Working
- Check for JavaScript console errors
- Verify the theme toggle script is loading properly
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### TypeScript Errors

If you encounter TypeScript errors during development:

```bash
# Check for TypeScript issues
npx tsc --noEmit
```
